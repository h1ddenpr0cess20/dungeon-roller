 * The party rolls through the dungeon as Nat's d20 (`nat/geometry.js`): the
 * same purple resin, the same inked edges, the same numbers, scaled down to
 * a little under a tile across.
 *
 * It is pushed about as a ball — a d20 is round enough — but it turns as the
 * die it is, and whatever face is nearest the ceiling is the number showing.
 * That is the roll: run into a monster and the number on top is what the
 * party fights with. When the die comes to rest it tips over onto its nearest
 * face, as Nat does, so a die that has stopped always reads one clean number.
 *
 * The turning is done here, on plain arrays, at the physics rate, so the
 * tests roll the same numbers the screen shows.
